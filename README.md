# SAMproject
Document annotation based on ontologies has become a tendency on the Semantic Web. Currently, there has been an increasing proliferation of ontologies on similar domains, each having a different structure of terms, properties and constraints. Thus, annotating a document using only one ontology, is, in most cases, not adequate to retrieve information efficiently. The idea of combining ontologies raises as a solution to improve the quality of document annotation, and consequently provides a more efficient retrieval, besides requiring less effort from the user. Taking into account the importance that multiple annotations has in the document annotation task, modularization raises as an interesting strategy to give the user the possibility of annotating with multiple ontologies.
The development of an architecture to extract knowledge from ontologies and to generate smaller modules to support the user in his/her document annotation task is described <a href="http://www.comp.ime.eb.br/images/repositorio-dissertacoes/2012-Priscilla_Gomes.pdf">here</a> (in portuguese). The great contribution and differential of this work are on the generation of modules from the userâ€™s document annotations. A prototype tool named SAM has been developed, such that from document annotations, it generates modules from other ontologies stored in a repository.

This project was built using Netbeans environment and the libraries used in the project were made available in the lib folder.
